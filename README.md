# Pet_Store
1. Create an interface called Mammel that can be implemented for the types of animals that sell in the pet shop. The Mammal interface contains 
all of the method headers for attributes or actions that are shared commonly amongst all of the animals.
2. Create an abstract classes that extends from interface Mammel that represents different pets. The abstract classes will be the base classes for 
the variety of specific animals in each category. The concrete animal classes will extend from one of the base classification abstract classes. 
Either the abstract classes or the concrete classes will implement the Comparable<T> interface and compareTo() method to compare some attributes 
of the pets.
3. Print out the animals information stored and generated by the subclasses. Polymorphism should be used to create a data structure to hold the objects 
that will be used to generate the output for the program. The user will be presented with a menu that will allow them to, at a minimum, see the animals 
available for adoption or view specific animal information in the list.
